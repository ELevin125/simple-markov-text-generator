# Markov Text Generator

This is a basic implementation of a Markov Text Generator, which generates new text based on a given input text using Markov chains. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

## Features

- **Upload Input Text**: Users can upload a .txt file containing the input text for the Markov Text Generator. The uploaded text will be used as training data to generate new text.
- **Adjustable Order and Output Length**: Users can specify the order of the Markov model, the desired length of the generated text, and whether or not a capital state should be used as the first generated word.
- **Generate Text**: Generate new text based on the input text and the specified parameters.

## How to Use
No external modules were used. Simply run main.py.

I gave myself just seven days to create a whole new update for Minecraft this update includes a bunch of brand new features including an overhauled biome a new biome actually a mob and a very cool and unique item as well as a bunch of new building blocks hello you beautiful Retreat people my name is gold gear and welcome back to another video so yes I made my own update in just seven days because why not honestly why what why not I'm not gonna hold you up so late let's let's just get into this video so we are going to start out with the brand new bottom that I added since it also contains some new blocks this is the Deep River Forest a new region that will spawn inside of your deserts quiver trees are actually a type of plant that enjoys growing in dry areas and they can actually get quite so up to 9 meters in real life and so we had to reflect that tall height in the game as well I'll try and remember to add a picture on the screen so as you can see these trees are actually made up out of three main parts first up we actually have the quiver stain block then we have the narrow the narrower then we have the smaller bits of quiver same and then at the very top we just have these cool little leaves these guys are actually quite cool you can see that they'll basically just like on the shape of whatever orientation I'm placing them on so as you can see they will automatically connect pretty much just like fences now these squirrel leaves also double as a sapling so if I just grab some bone meal and apply it onto the sleeve you can see that a brand new cover tree will spawn and yeah all of their varieties are inside of here even though I somehow got two of the same ones okay there is a different one I almost thought I discovered the new bug there now as you can see the square release this will generate all over the floor of this region along with a another block he dried grass and it's pretty much exactly what it says on the tin it is gross that had died because I don't know if you've ever seen like actual African or like dry area across but uh they're not actually green they're definitely more yellowish so this should be a bit more accurate of what cross that would actually look like if they grew in the desert now these thin pieces of queer same actually have a very unique purpose that the name kind of heads towards so I'll show that to you a bit later on in this video and trust me it's actually quite cool I'm very happy with how it turned out now all of the desert type of biomes including the quiver Forest is actually home to a brand new Bob let's oh you may have just seen one right there ah look at this guy this is the desert shark and if you like to watch out you might end up becoming its prey now if you look very carefully you might be able to tell that there is actually a bob hiding here and this is the desert shark now this mob's whole thing is the fact that it will lay in the sand and camouflage itself waiting for an unsuspecting player to pass by now just exactly what do you think will happen when you walk over this guy well maybe actually demonstrate to you so I'm your little guy let's see if it will try to lay a trap and if I walk over it uh yeah if I were in survival mode I would be suffocating right now because it will drag you down underneath the sad for you to suffocate and it so that it can consume your flesh later on say see if I can find this guy again and if we spawn it a rabbit why you guys moving around so much now if I just place down a unsuspecting rabbit or or not I guess I guess you can just walk over there instead but it will jump up and bite the rabbit before submerging itself under the ground and resetting its trap I'm actually very happy with how they turned out they really do have a unique feel today and I can't wait to see people actually use them to make like traps and stuff because yeah being able to drag a player or any entity for that matter beneath the ground could make for some pretty cool traps as well as some secret base entrances so yeah here is a nice close-up shot of the desert shark and it's currently playing it's walking animation so ignore the flapping but as you can see it's quite cool it's almost like a weird combination of like a Bulbasaur and a turtle and then they got the guardian tail it's weird okay now onto the Savannah and as you can see it is looking quite different new blocks new structures but wait what's this I I made a typo but yeah I just want to ask it if you have made it up until this point in the video to maybe consider subscribing and even leaving a like it really helps out the channel and allows me to make these cool add-ons for you guys to enjoy for free 3. now back to the actual video there's a lot going on here so let's keep going so just like in the desert the dry grass will also spawn here it's a it's a bit more true to the actual like color of grass like I mentioned earlier so I enhanced the color of the actual like grass in foliage to be more in line with the colors of like actual African landscape as well as the water which is a bit more blue towards the surface but as you can see it still has that nice dark blue area the lower it goes but the actual surface of the Savannah has also changed notably we actually make use of the new packed mud block which I think has a really cool texture that fits in perfectly with this Vibe I'm going for as well as a new block called the strata I think that's how you pronounce it or the straighter I have no clue I I speak very basic English help me

straighta so yeah this is basically a new type of stone that will spawn and it is also directional so as you can see you can rotate this and make some weird floor patterns although I have personally very fond of this top picture I think it looks quite smooth it just I just like it so you can see the process of changing up the colors and just enhancing the generation with some more interesting blocks and textures really made the Savannah stand out a lot more and I just think it looks really pretty but in the distance you may have also noticed a new block that I haven't mentioned yet and there's actually one right next to me and there's one up there as well let's go to this larger one I think it looks a bit prettier but this is the termite heels now African termites or Mount building termites actually build these extremely large mounts like seriously Google it is actually insane how big these things get so naturally I had to translate this into the game somehow and this is how these Mounds were born now the cool thing about these mounts is actually the fact that they're not just static structures that I bought and placed in here no no no no no if I grab one of these and place it down somewhere just Place one down over here but actually over here instead it will actually expand on its own over time so if I just increase the random tick speed over the game to make it happen a little bit faster you can see that it will start to expand and grow on itself and I think this one actually stopped at a very small size so let's try this again with the print one come on are you kidding okay there it goes yeah there it goes yep they basically vary in size so all of the ones that you will see naturally generate in the world are actually generated through the same mechanism that will get placed like this oh this one is turning out very interesting let's actually turn the textbook back to normal this one's very it's a very interesting shape but yeah as you can see it will generate these cool looking mounts when she place them down and as you can see they will generate some very interesting shapes as well I mean look at this thing and this was naturally generated with the system you've got these two sacred Peaks and a nice wide base that actually got generated completely naturally I just thought that was very cool but I haven't even mentioned the best parts about these termite use because you see if into survival mode then you'll see that if I break this without any tool we'll get dirt but we also have a chance to get sad so this is actually a renewable source of sand and dirt and obviously you can use a silk touch pickaxe and that will give you the physical item but otherwise you can just Farm them like this and obtain a bunch of sand and dirt for your boat and now we have finally reached the part of the video that I'm going to show you the new item that I was talking about earlier so before me we have a crafting bench and in here I can actually craft a brand new item called the quiver an empty quiver to be more specific now this item's main functionality requires that you place it inside of your offhand slot and as you can see it will actually get equipped onto your skin uh my cape's in the way let me fix this okay one Cape removal later as you can see it's on my backer right over there and you can actually load this thing up with up to four stacks of arrows so all you need to do is to is to select some arrows and then if you if you sneak it will actually get loaded in and you can see we have 64 out of 256. and the cool thing is this works for half stacks and it will max out and only actually put the amount of arrows into the quiver that will fit into there so as you can see I can try to put this extra 44 in there but that just won't happen whoa that was very up close and personal now another small little feature of the quiver that probably like two percent of players who actually care about if it is that much is I actually made it so that the position of the strap on your back and chest will actually become larger if you equipped some order so as you can see the quiver strap will actually show up on top of your armor so you can show it off and you will look very snazzy and adventurous with your armor at your quiver I mean if we hold a bow I mean just just look at us does this not look epic so let's say I'm in a combat situation and I'm shooting about then well I don't really have time to open up my inventory and to remove a stack of arrows from the quiver so instead what this thing will do is to I don't know how to describe it other than to your heart reload your arrow Supply so basically if I shoot an arrow you'll basically see that it will get replenished as you can see we now have 254 arrows in our quiver to 253 and so on but our Arrow Supply will continue to be replenished and naturally if I go ahead and collect these arrows I can place all of them back into the quiver Again by just holding them and sneaking and now they're back inside of the quiver again how cool is that obscure overrated meme reference and I missed but yes my friends this will conclude this video I hope that you guys did enjoy it like for all my add-ons you can find the download for this in the description and if you enjoyed this video feel free to leave a like and to subscribe if you are new around here it really helps out a lot and I appreciate it greatly but thanks for watching guys and I'll see all of you again in the future with a brand new video cheers [Music]



hello beautiful youtube people my name is called gear and welcome back to another video so you guys can read the title you know why you're here so yeah without further ado without any of you really uh let's get started with making flappy birds inside of minecraft pedro ok so first things first how exactly does one create flappy bird well

okay and now we have this beautiful game of flappy bird just look at those graphics i know i know i can pretty much become like a one-man triple-a studio or something i know thanks thanks but anyway now that we have like this prototype working it should just be as simple as sporting this into minecraft right right okay so just how exactly am i going to create flappy bird in minecraft well minecraft bedrock has a cool feature called gametest its original purpose was to test if your add-ons and stuff worked correctly but nowadays it basically means that you can create any sort of add-on using the javascript programming language it works very similar to nodejs if you know what that means good for you but anyway moving on to start off i first need to figure out if i can use minecraft sport in physics or if i'm going to need to create my own somehow making my own may actually be simpler since it's quite basic physics i pretty much just need some gravity and make the bird flap every now and again but the issue is the fact that minecraft's game taste is running once per tick which means 20 times a second what this means for us is that our final game of flappy bird is going to look like a stuttering mess if we move the bird according to our own physics so that's why i'm hoping i can just use minecraft sporting one since that runs at like 60 times a second or something i don't actually have any numbers for that but yeah moving on luckily mojang recently added the set velocity method to gametest that should make it very easy for us to have the bird flap since we can just basically tallied to move up a bit uh where's uh where's the bird i i barely started and there's already bugs all right they're fighting up there why are they up there ah well it seems to kind of work and now we just need to actually make a screen of sort to display these guys on so what i'm doing here is creating two simple commands create and start and then i'm simply using them to trigger a function that will board a board or a display for us based on the player's position what this means is that we can create a new game of flappy bird pretty much wherever we run the command okay so it's the wrong color but uh we're getting there so some more coding lighter and now we have this beauty but i don't know about you but i'm kind of getting tired of looking at mode glare model not to mention the clear lack of pipes so let's create some models for that luckily the actual flappy bird uses pixel art and i if you haven't noticed minecraft is also quite blocky so creating a 3d model from it shouldn't be all that difficult except of course we actually need to make it 3d but yeah i think it turned out quite cool as for the pipes what i plan to do for the pipes is to have multiple pipe segments and then depending on the size of the pipe that we want we just spawn in a bunch of these pipe segments and then just place sort of like a lid on top of all of our segments so here i'm making like the very tip or like the lid of the pipe with that low edge and stuff and they also added a bit of shine to the texture and to make it look a bit more round or something i don't know okay so i just had myself a nice sandwich and while i was eating i came to realize that doing pipe segments is a dumb idea i need to use my own collision in any case so there is literally no reason why i can't just stretch out the body of the normal pipe with an animation that should be way simpler than actually spawning in a bunch of segments now aren't you actually adding these models into the game

spawning in these pipes were such a pain basically what i settled with was to spawn in two pipe models with a gap in the middle now looking back i could have saved so much time if i just combined these two parts into one singular model that contained two pipes but no i wanted to be able to adjust this gap automatically through code or something why anyway for the time being they are working as you can see we have this nice little staircase type of thing that's going on while that left one is looking completely broken i don't know i'm writing this script literally three months later and i can't remember what it was or how i fixed it all that i know is that there's another hour of footage of me trying to fix it but in the end i did fix it as you can see here but at what cost that is unknown these fives get playing me with new and weird bugs while working on this project like literally every two seconds and yeah i'm not gonna mention it since that will make for boring content but i just thought i'd throw that out there and these guys were such a pain okay having these pipes is cool and all but we still need to actually turn this into a game now so what i need to do next is to spawn in a bunch of these pipes next to each other and slowly move them from the right side of the screen to the left that way the bird will look like it is moving forward even though it is staying completely still although they should preferably be spread out not all stacked on top of each other like this are much bigger something else that i didn't mention earlier is that once the pipes reach the end of the screen we need to create like a function or something that would teleport them back to the front of the screen that way we can have a nice loop thing happening kind of like having a piston feed tape except it was made with much more tears we did it boys we've got pipes we've got them moving and you got them looping it should be smooth sailing from here on wait what right right there can you see it

okay so once these pipes reach the end of the screen i teleport them back to the front but for some reason when you teleport something in minecraft it does this weird animation thing where you can actually see them moving from point a to b usually when using an interpol or something it's much more subtle and doesn't last nearly as long as it does here for some reason white lasts longer in this case i don't know how did i fix it well i just i just slapped some invisibility on there and cool day probably not the best fix but i if it works it works next up we need to add some player controls to the game and by that i'd literally just mean move the bird when the player does something originally i may surround a bit with using the player's jump button so that when the player jumped the bird actually flapped but it felt a bit weird to use and so i just settled on creating there's really some dust that you can click with and when you do that boom the bird jumps wonderful okay so you know this code that i've been writing up until now what if we just uh

yeah yeah the guy is extremely messy and honestly i get sick just looking at it so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just spend the next hour or so just cleaning it up a bit and then hopefully it should be smooth saying everything is wrong is that someone please help me yeah so as you can probably tell from that refactoring this code didn't really go according to plan for some reason my new clean coat just kept breaking left right and center the whole reason i decided to clean up this coat was because i was too lazy to fix a bug in the old version i thought cleaning it up would probably get rid of that bug but now i just created so many more and my genius monkey brain forgot to make a backup of my old code so at this point i pretty much have nothing the old code didn't exist anymore and the new code simply just didn't work and showed no intention of working in the new near future but just as all hopes seem to be lost i remembered hey i uploaded the add-on to my phone to see if it would run on there and wait it's probably still there so yeah i was likely able to recover most of my old code by just like copying it from my phone although the whole jumping thing was missing so i would have to rewrite that here we are one day of refactoring code and we are actually worse off than when we started i done this project temporarily and came back to it three months later aka now yes this project was started on the 1st of march anyway we still have some stuff left to do namely fixing the jumping fixing the million of bugs that still plague the pipes adding collision to the pipes and lastly adding a scoring system naturally being the very professional youtuber that i am i got absolutely no footage of me doing any of that look so um here's the final project i guess flabby bird in minecraft but right before we get to that here's a message from this week's sponsor the subscribe button the subscribe button is a slow rate button at the bottom of your screen if you press it you'll see it does this cool little thing where it changes color as well as sporting me but yeah thanks for subscribing i really appreciate it i can't believe we're actually nearly at 20 000 subscribers okay here we are inside of the game so let's see this thing in action so all that i need to do is to open up the chat and then just do exclamation mark and create and once i press enter you can see our game of flappy bird will start and now whenever i just right click or no yeah it is right click on this little item here you can see that we will flap and we are literally playing flappy bird inside of minecraft and i'm actually struggling to focus on playing this game and talking now you may have been able to notice it but i did add a little bit of like a cushion to the collision so yeah okay there well i died there but anyway like i was saying um i added a bit of a cushioning to the collision so even when you collide with like the edge of the bike you don't die just because i found out that since you haven't like a perspective looking at this thing sometimes even though it doesn't look like you collided from this perspective you do collide and then it just felt a little bit broken so add in a little bit of like a buffer or a cushioning zone and yeah these pipes they more or less work now i haven't stumbled onto a new bike related to them in a bit so i think i was able to crack most of these bugs but yeah maybe but yeah i won't be surprised if another poker randomly pops up oh yeah and something else that i added is the slow button down here to restart the game so if we press this you can see the game will restart and we have a little countdown again and here we go playing round two of our little flappy bird game and you can see our score is there on the bottom of the screen why do i suck this much in flappy bird but yeah i hope that you guys did enjoy this video if you want to download and try this out for yourself there will be a download link in the description i guess i will see you again in the future with a brand new video cheers [Music] you
